## Awesome Calculator

This project I started from my passionate. I want to create desktop application while simulate development workflow in real world. so this project should contain:

- Split task to issue on github. so if you want to help. just pick issue and working on it.
- Project board on github. we can track which task is doing/done. so we can easier manage timeline and resource that we use to complete project.
- Github action for automate test. we need to delivery **quality product** and make sure thing doesn't break after we made some change on our code base.
- Automation release application with tag on github. after product complete and pass test on github action. we will auto publish artifact to new release.

## Technology stack

- Electron - for delivery desktop application to every platfrom with javascript.
- Typescript - for self document and speedup development process in long run.
- Vue.js - for frontend. I want to learn this so I add to this project.
- Jest - unit test that will make sure we delivery quality product.
- Github action - for automate testing and deployment.
